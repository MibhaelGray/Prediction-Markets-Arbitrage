Project Goal: Prediction Market Arbitrage Tool
The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that identifies and exploits arbitrage opportunities across multiple prediction markets (primarily Polymarket and Kalshi) by:

Continuously monitoring identical or correlated prediction contracts across platforms
Identifying price discrepancies that create risk-free profit opportunities
Calculating optimal position sizes to maximize arbitrage returns
Executing trades automatically when profitable opportunities arise
Tracking performance metrics and arbitrage history
